# Money Tracker ðŸ¤‘  

A personal project to explore Flutter and learn its fundamentals. This simple app allows users to track their income and expenses without using a database. Instead, it relies on an in-memory list of objects, meaning that all data is lost when the app is closed.  

## Features ðŸš€  

- Add and delete income and expense records  
- Simple UI for easy tracking  
- No database â€“ data exists only during the app session
